I am quite an optomist when comes to learning new things. I tend to have a personality that says, "Let's do this thing! How bad could it be?" Naturally, learning skills is often harder than my then, "past-self" would like to believe and I end up hitting a slump after a digging in a little deeper.

When we started learning Rails, there was a good bit of hype surrounding it (because it IS really awesome afterall). However, I along with many of my classmates had forgotten that even magic requires the magician learn the skill of slight-of-hand. To speak plainly; Rails is powerful and wonderful to use, but the learning curve is steep since so much of the syntax that we've learned to love is abstracted away. To this day, this leaves me scratching my head at some of the expressions used in a Rails program.

Upon some more reflection, I think I've really learned that while I will dare not become a pesimist about learning new skills, I think it would be advantagous to tread realistically and enthusiastically. Our expectations often times define our reality and while changing expectation don't make understanding syntax EASIER, it definitely does help you appreciate the challenge along the way.
