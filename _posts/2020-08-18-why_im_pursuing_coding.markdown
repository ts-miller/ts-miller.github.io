I am taking the leap. I've quit my job and pushed in all my chip to this journey. Despite having a new baby and a relatively stable, well paying job, I'm pursuing coding.

This decision has come at a cost, rest assured. I'm sacrificing part of a down payment on a house, 5 months of my time, and the position on a ladder of employment. This has prompted a lot of questions from the people who love me and I thought this would be a good place to talk about why exactly I'm making this choice.

I grew up in a very small town of only about 700 people. While children living in cities were blocks from friends, I could count miles to my best friends house. I did live in close proximity to my uncle however, who while I was young, lived with my grandparents. I remember when he got his first computer back in the late 90's. It was an amazing machine that costs many thousands of dollars and had less storage space on the hard drive space than a DVD.

While I lacked many close friends and lived in a place where nothing happened, my uncle became a bit of a mentor to me. He would allow me to sit next to him for hours and even allowed me to play games, and surf the internet. This was how I spent much of my childhood.

Point being: I've always had a love of technology.

Fast forward 15 years and I found myself working a job that has nothing to do with tech and leaves me feeling unsatisfied. Somewhere along the way, I believed the lie that you can't do what you love as a career. I had heard so many people tell me "Pursue your passions!" but I felt the need to protect what was most dear to me. I'd heard others say things like, "Well I used to enjoy what I did but then I did it for a job and it stopped being fun". I was afraid of this happening.

I've finally decided that I just no longer believe this lie. I've got one life to live and I'm not willing to spend it doing something that leaves me feeling empty and doesn't challenge me in ways that excite me. Coding is the answer for me, because it combines two things that I love; tech and art. It marries logic with creativity in a way that engages my heart and my brain and I believe *that* is something worth pursuing.
